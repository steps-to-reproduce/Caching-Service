# Introduction

This is a docker container based authoritative DNS server for your LAN cache. This is built using BIND-9. This is meant to be used in conjunction with `testing/generic_cache` and `testing/sni_proxy`.


## Prerequisites

* Installing Docker
  - Setting up the repository
  
    ```shell
    $ sudo apt-get update;
    $ sudo apt-get install \
      apt-transport-https \
      ca-certificates \
      curl \
      gnupg-agent \
      software-properties-common;
    $ curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -;
    $ sudo add-apt-repository \
     "deb [arch=arm64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(lsb_release -cs) \
     stable";
    ```
  - Installing Docker CE
    
    ```shell
    $ sudo apt-get update;
    $ sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io;
    $ sudo systemctl status docker;
    ```
   - Adding username to Docker group
   
      ```shell
      $ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER};
      $ su - ${USER};
      ```
      
   * Installing net-tools

      ```shell
      $ sudo apt-get install net-tools
      ```   

   * Installing dnsutils

     ```shell
      $ sudo apt-get install dnsutils
      ```
 
## Building and Running Light_DNS
 
  * Clonning this repository
 
	```shell
	$ git clone https://github.com/steps-to-reproduce/Caching-Service.git;
	```
  * Building Light_DNS Docker image
	
	```shell
	$ cd Light_DNS;
	$ docker build -t testing/light_dns .
	```
  * Running the docker container as a daemon
  
    ```shell
    $ docker run -td \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      --name <container name> \
      -p <Your IP>:53:53/udp \
      -p <Your IP>:53:53/tcp \
      testing/light_dns:latest;
    ```
    
## Usage
 
  This is a authoritative DNS service for your LAN cache. If you have your cache set-up, then you would need to add the domain, thier IP addresses and corresponding hostnames in that domain. To do this, run the `add.sh` script and follow the interactive prompts.
  
  ```shell
  $ ./add.sh
  ```
  
  Now the hostnames added can be querried.

## Monitoring

 * Opening an iteractive bash on the container.
  
    ```shell
    $ docker exec -it <container name> bash
    ```
    
 * Monitor the logs.
 
    * Query log
      
        ```shell
        $ tail --follow /var/log/bind/queries.log
        ```
    * General log
      
        ```shell
        $ tail --follow /var/log/bind/general.log
        ```
    * List all the log files
         
        ```shell
        $ ls -ll /var/log/bind/
        ```
   The logs show the hostnames queried for, clients querying, etc. dynamically.    
   
   * Looking at all the domains added and the hostnames in them
      
     All the domains added are in the folder, `/dns_domains` and all the hostservers in each doamin can be found in the file `<DOMAIN NAME IN CAPS>`.
    

## Testing and Monitoring

* Creating a Docker container named ```test```. bound to ```127.0.0.1```
  
  ```shell
    $ docker run -td \
      --restart unless-stopped \
      --name test \
      -p 127.0.0.1:53:53/udp \
      -p 127.0.0.1:53:53/tcp \
      testing/light_dns:latest;
    ```

 * Opening an iteractive bash on the container.
  
    ```shell
    $ docker exec -it test bash
    ```
    
 * Add a custom test domain 
 
    For example: 
      Addtition of a domain name `test` which is managed by the cache at IP 100.100.100.100, responsible for hosts www.testing.com, test.net and *test.with.wildchar would look like.
  
    ```shell
    $ ./add
    $ Enter the DNS domain you would like to change (must not have spaces) : test 
    $ The requested domain is not defined
    $ Enter the IP address of the CACHE for this DOMAIN : 100.100.100.100
    $ The file named TEST has been created
    $ The ENV TEST=100.100.100.100 has been created
    $ Enter the hostserver names to be added to the domain TEST (Ctrl+D to quit adding)
    $ www.testing.com
    $ *.test.with.wildchar
    $ testing.net
    $ ^D
    $
    $  * Stopping domain name service... bind9 
    $ waiting for pid 55 to die
    $                                           [OK]

  
  * Querying for the cache IP which are responsible for a perticular hostserver, for ex, www.testing.com
  
    Run the following command on the docker host machine
    
    ```shell
    $ dig www.testing.com @127.0.0.1
    ```
    
    If the DNS server is running properly, then the result would look like
    
    ```
